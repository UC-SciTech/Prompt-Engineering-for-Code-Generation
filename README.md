Template repository for UC ITS capstone projects source code. For more information see the [getting started](./docs/getting-started-with-source-control.md).

## Project Information

We built a framework that explores different prompt engineering techniques and how to craft them effectively to generate desired code generation outputs from the LLMs. By conducting the experiments using this framework, we can improve how LLMs generate code, making it more accurate and relevant to the task.

## Documentation

The [`./docs`](./docs/readme.md) folder contains the documentation to navigate through project information and experiment jupyter notebook files denoted in .ipynb
